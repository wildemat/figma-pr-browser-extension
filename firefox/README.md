# Figma PR Extension - Firefox Version

A Firefox-compatible browser extension that automatically processes Figma links in GitHub PR descriptions and generates design specs.

## Firefox-Specific Differences

This version has been adapted for Firefox compatibility:

- **Manifest v2**: Uses manifest version 2 (Firefox standard)
- **Browser API**: Uses `browser.*` instead of `chrome.*` APIs
- **Permissions**: Permissions are declared in manifest rather than as host_permissions
- **Background Scripts**: Uses persistent background scripts instead of service workers

## Installation for Firefox

1. Clone or download this Firefox extension version
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox" â†’ "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Select the `manifest.json` file from the extension folder
5. Get a Figma API token from [Figma Settings](https://www.figma.com/settings) â†’ Account â†’ Personal access tokens
6. Click the extension icon and enter your token

### For Users
